* TODO Optional values
  + How to represent (unbound slots vs. nil)
* TODO Coerce sequence data automatically
  Generate =initialize-instance= methods, and maybe =setf= methods,
  that coerce initargs to the correct types where required (currently
  vectors for repeated fields)
* STARTED Use proper conditions
  browns protocol buffer stuff seems to have nice error handling
* DONE Get rid of =with-gensyms=
* DONE Start/Type code terminology
  Seems to be like this:
  + start code :: part of the wire format; ORed field number and wire
                  type
  + wire type :: a small integer indicating the type of the next chunk
                 of data
