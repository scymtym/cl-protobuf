* Bugs
** TODO /* */ Comments do not work
** TODO Proper name resolution
   + Name resolution function needs a stack of current parent objects
   + There has to be a distinction between
     + Finding the descriptor instance that is designated by some name
     + Finding the Lisp type that is designated by some name
* Refactor
** TODO Use bind consistently
   Since we already use bind, use it throughout
** TODO Simplify module structure
   In cl-protobuf.asd
* Features
** TODO Call a function to compute names of accessors
** TODO Serializers and deserializers are generated without docstrings
** STARTED Coerce sequence data automatically
   Generate =initialize-instance= methods, and maybe =setf= methods,
   that coerce initargs to the correct types where required (currently
   vectors for repeated fields)
** STARTED Use proper conditions
   browns protocol buffer stuff seems to have nice error handling
* Tasks
** TODO How to deal with initforms?
   Google's protocol buffer has some notion of a default object which
   provides the initial values of uninitialized fields
** TODO Optional fields
   + How to represent (unbound slots vs. nil)
** DONE Get rid of =with-gensyms=
** DONE Start/Type code terminology
   Seems to be like this:
   + start code :: part of the wire format; ORed field number and wire
                   type
   + wire type :: a small integer indicating the type of the next chunk
                  of data
